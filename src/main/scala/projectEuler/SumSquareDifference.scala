 * Problem 6. The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
